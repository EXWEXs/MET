\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This chapter describes how to install the MET package.
 MET has been developed and tested on Linux operating systems.
 Support for additional platforms and compilers may be added in future releases.
 The MET package requires many external libraries to be available on the
 user's computer prior to installation.
 Required and recommended libraries, how to install MET, the MET directory
 structure, and sample cases are described in the following sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Supported architectures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package was developed on Debian Linux using the GNU compilers and
 the Portland Group (PGI) compilers.
 The MET package has also been built on several other Linux distributions
 using the GNU, PGI, and Intel compilers.
 Past versions of MET have also been ported to IBM machines using the IBM
 compilers, but we are currently unable to support this option as the developmen
t team lacks access to an IBM machine for testing.
 Other machines may be added to this list in future releases as they are
 tested.
 In particular, the goal is to support those architectures supported by
 the WRF model itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package runs on a single processor.
 Outside organizations have tentative plans to run it across multiple processors
 in the future.
 Should this occur, the information will be included in future versions
 of this documentation.
 Therefore, none of the utilities necessary for running WRF on multiple
 processors are necessary for running MET.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Programming languages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package is written primarily in C/C++ in order to be compatible
 with an extensive verification code base in C/C++ already in existence.
 In addition, the object-based MODE verification tool relies heavily on
 the object-oriented aspects of C++.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Knowledge of C/C++ is not necessary to use the MET package.
 The MET package has been designed to be highly configurable through the
 use of ASCII configuration files, enabling a great deal of flexibility
 without the need for source code modifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
NCEP's BUFRLIB is written entirely in Fortran.
 The portion of MET that handles the interface to the BUFRLIB for reading
 PrepBufr point observation files is also written in Fortran.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package is intended to be a tool for the modeling community to use
 and adapt.
 As users make upgrades and improvements to the tools, they are encouraged
 to offer those upgrades to the broader community by offering feedback to
 the developers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Required compilers and scripting languages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package was developed and tested using the GNU g++/gfortran compilers,
 the Portland Group (PGI) pgCC/pgf90 compilers, and the Intel icc/ifort
 compilers.
 As additional compilers are successfully tested, they will be added to
 the list of supported platforms/compilers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The GNU make utility is used in building all executables and is therefore
 required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package consists of a group of command line utilities that are compiled
 separately.
 The user may choose to run any subset of these utilities to employ the
 type of verification methods desired.
 New tools developed and added to the toolkit will be included as command
 line utilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In order to control the desired flow through MET, users are encouraged to
 run the tools via a script.
 Some sample scripts are provided in the distribution; these examples are
 written in the Bourne shell.
 However, users are free to adapt these sample scripts to any scripting
 language desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Required libraries and optional utilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Three external libraries are required for compiling/building MET and should
 be downloaded and installed before attempting to install MET.
 Additional external libraries required for building advanced features in
 MET are discussed in section 2.6 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
1.
 NCEP's BUFRLIB is used by MET to decode point-based observation datasets
 in PrepBufr format.
 BUFRLIB is distributed and supported by NCEP and is freely available for
 download from NCEP's website at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 BUFRLIB requires C and Fortran-90 compilers that should be from the same
 family of compilers used when building MET.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
2.
 Several tools within MET use Unidata's NetCDF libraries for writing output
 NetCDF files.
 NetCDF libraries are distributed and supported by Unidata and are freely
 available for download from Unidata's website at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The same family of compilers used to build NetCDF should be used when building
 MET.
 MET is compatible with most NetCDF version 3 releases, but it is not yet
 compatible with NetCDF version 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
3.
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is used by MET when computing confidence
 intervals.
 GSL is distributed and supported by the GNU Software Foundation and is
 freely available for download from the GNU website at 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
4.
 The Zlib is used by MET for compression when writing post-script files
 from tools (e.g.
 MODE and Wavelet-Stat).
 Zlib is distributed and supported Zlib.org and is freely available for download
 from the Zlib website at 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Two additional utilities are strongly recommended for use with MET:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
1.
 The Unified Post-Processor is recommended for post-processing the raw WRF
 model output prior to verifying the model forecasts with MET.
 The Unified Post-Processor is freely available for download from the "downloads
" section of the WRF-NMM user's website at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.dtcenter.org/wrf-nmm/users
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 MET can read data on a standard, de-staggered grid and on pressure or regular
 levels in the vertical.
 The Unified Post-Processor outputs model data in this format from both
 WRF cores, the NMM and the ARW.
 However, the Unified Post-Processor is not strictly required as long as
 the user can produce gridded model output on a standard de-staggered grid
 on pressure or regular levels in the vertical.
 Two-dimensional fields (e.g., precipitation amount) are also accepted for
 some modules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
2.
 The copygb utility is recommended for re-gridding model and observation
 datasets in GRIB format to a common verification grid.
 This utility is highly recommended when using the Grid-Stat, Series-Analysis,
 Pcp-Combine, Wavelet-Stat, or MODE tools.
 Prior to running MET, the model output and verifying gridded observations
 must be placed on the same grid.
 The copygb utility is distributed as part of the Unified Post-Processor
 and is available from other sources as well.
 However, the copygb utility is not strictly required as long as users can
 ensure that their model and gridded observation datasets reside on a common
 grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Installation of required libraries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
As described in section 2.5, some external libraries are required for building
 the MET:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
1.
 NCEP's BUFRLIB is used by the MET to decode point-based observation datasets
 in PrepBufr format.
 Once you have downloaded and unpacked the BUFRLIB tarball, refer to the
 README_BUFRLIB file.
 When compiling the library using the GNU C and Fortran compilers, users
 are strongly encouraged to use the -DUNDERSCORE and -fno-second-underscore
 options.
 Also, MET expects the BUFRLIB archive file to be named "libbufr.a".
 Therefore, compiling the BUFRLIB using the GNU compilers consists of the
 following 3 steps:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code

\series medium
* gcc -c -DUNDERSCORE *.c

2.
 Unidata's NetCDF libraries are used by several tools within MET for writing
 output NetCDF files.
 The same family of compilers used to build NetCDF should be used when building
 MET.
 Users may also find some utilities built for NetCDF such as ncdump and
 ncview useful for viewing the contents of NetCDF files.

3.
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is used by MET for random sampling and
 normal and binomial distribution computations when estimating confidence
 intervals.
 Precompiled binary packages are available for most GNU/Linux distributions
 and may be installed with root access.
 When installing GSL from a precompiled package on Debian Linux, the developer's
 version of GSL must be used; otherwise, use the GSL version available from
 the GNU website (

\begin_layout Section
Building the MET package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Building the MET package consists of three main steps: (1) install the required
 libraries, (2) configure the environment variables, and (3) configure and
 execute the build.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Install the required libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series medium
Please refer to Section 2.6 on how to install the required and optional libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Set Environment Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET build uses environment variables to specify the locations of the
 needed external libraries.
 For each library, there is a set of three environment variables to describe
 the locations: $MET_<lib>, $MET_<lib>INC and $MET_<lib>LIB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The $MET_<lib> environment variable can be used if the external library
 is installed such that there is a main directory which has a subdirectory
 called "lib" containing the library files and another subdirectory called
 "include" containing the include files.
 For example, if the NetCDF library files are installed in /opt/netcdf/lib
 and the include files are in /opt/netcdf/include, you can just define the
 $MET_NETCDF environment variable to be "/opt/netcdf".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The $MET_<lib>INC and $MET_<lib>LIB environment variables are used if the
 library and include files for an external library are installed in separate
 locations.
 In this case, both environment variables must be specified and the associated
 $MET_<lib> variable will be ignored.
 For example, if the NetCDF include files are installed in /opt/include/netcdf
 and the library files are in /opt/lib/netcdf, then you would set $MET_NETCDFINC
 to "/opt/include/netcdf" and $MET_NETCDFLIB to "/opt/lib/netcdf".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following environment variables should also be set:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- Set $MET_NETCDF to point to the main NetCDF directory, or set $MET_NETCDFINC
 to point to the directory with the NetCDF include files and set $MET_NETCDFLIB
 to point to the directory with the NetCDF library files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- Set $MET_BUFR to point to the main BUFR directory, or set $MET_BUFRLIB
 to point to the directory with the BUFR library files.
 Because we don't use any BUFR library include files, you don't need to
 specify $MET_BUFRINC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- Set $MET_GSL to point to the main GSL directory, or set $MET_GSLINC to
 point to the directory with the GSL include files and set $MET_GSLLIB to
 point to the directory with the GSL library files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- If compiling support for GRIB2, set $MET_GRIB2CINC and $MET_GRIB2CLIB
 to point to the main GRIB2C directory which contains both the include and
 library files.
 These are used instead of $MET_GRIB2C since the main GRIB2C directory does
 not contain include and lib subdirectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Make Targets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The autoconf utility provides some standard make targets for the users.
 In MET, the following standard targets have been implemented and tested:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
1.
 all - compile all of the components in the package, but don't install them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
2.
 install - install the components (where is described below).
 Will also compile if "make all" hasn't been done yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
3.
 clean - remove all of the temporary files created during the compilation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
4.
 uninstall - remove the installed files.
 For us, these are the executables and the files in $MET_BASE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
MET also has the following non-standard targets:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
5.
 test - runs the scripts/test_all.sh script.
 You must run "make install" before using this target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Sample test cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Once the MET package has been built successfully, the user is encouraged
 to run the sample test scripts provided.
 They are run using make test in the top-level directory.
 Execute the following commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
1.
 Type 'make test >& make_test.log &' to run all of the test scripts in the
 directory.
 These test scripts use test data supplied with the tarball.
 For instructions on running your own data, please refer to the MET User's
 Guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
2.
 Type 'tail -f make_test.log' to view the execution of the test script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
3.
 When the test script is finished, type 'CNTRL-C' to quit the tail.
 Look in "out" to find the output files for these tests.
 Each tool has a separate, appropriately named subdirectory for its output
 files.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
4.
 In particular, check that the PB2NC tool ran without error.
 If there was an error, run "make clean" then rerun your configure command
 adding "--disable-block4" to your configure command line and rebuild MET.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Configuration File Details
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Many of the MET tools use a configuration file to set parameters.
 This prevents the command line from becoming too long and cumbersome and
 makes the output easier to duplicate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The configuration files that control many of the MET tools contain formatted
 ASCII text.
 This format was updated for METv4.0 and continues to be used in subsequent
 releases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Settings common to multiple tools are described in the top part of the share/met
/config/README file and settings specific to individual tools are described
 beneath the common settings.
 Settings for the MET-Tropical Cyclone tools are described in share/met/config/R
EADME-TC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
A configuration file entry is an entry name, followed by an equal sign =,
 followed by an entry value, and is terminated by a semicolon ;.
 The configuration file itself is one large dictionary consisting of entries,
 some of which are dictionaries themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The configuration file language supports the following data types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- Dictionary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- Grouping of one or more entries enclosed by curly braces {}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- Array:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- List of one or more entries enclosed by square braces [].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- Array elements are separated by commas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- String
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- A character string enclosed by double quotation marks "".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- Integer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- A numeric integer value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- Float:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- A numeric float value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- Boolean:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- A boolean value (TRUE or FALSE).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- Threshold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- A threshold type (<, <=, ==, !-, >=, or >) followed by a numeric value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- The threshold type may also be specified using two letter abbreviations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
(lt, le, eq, ne, ge, gt).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
- Piecewise-Linear Function (currently used only by MODE):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- A list of (x, y) points enclosed in parenthesis ().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
- The (x, y) points are *NOT* separated by commas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The context of a configuration entry matters.
 If an entry cannot be found in the expected dictionary, the MET tools recursive
ly search for that entry in the parent dictionaries, all the way up to the
 top-level configuration file dictionary.
 If you'd like to apply the same setting across all cases, you can simply
 specify it once at the top-level.
 Alternatively, you can specify a setting at the appropriate dictionary
 level to have finer control over the behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In order to make the configuration files more readable, several descriptive
 integer types have been defined in the ConfigConstants file.
 These integer names may be used on the right-hand side for many configuration
 file entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Each of the configurable MET tools expects a certain set of configuration
 entries.
 Examples of the MET configuration files can be found in the installed directori
es share/met/config and scripts/config.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
When you pass a configuration file to a MET tool, the tool actually parses
 three different configuration files in the following order:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
(1) Reads share/met/config/ConfigConstants to define constants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
(2) Reads the default configuration file for the tool from share/met/config.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
(3) Reads the user-specified configuration file from the command line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Many of the entries from step (2) are overwritten by the user-specified
 entries from step (3).
 Therefore, the configuration file you pass in on the command line really
 only needs to contain entries that differ from the defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The configuration file language supports the use of environment variables.
 When scripting up many calls to the MET tools, you may find it convenient
 to use them.
 They are specified as ${ENV_VAR}, where ENV_VAR is the name of the environment
 variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET_BASE variable is defined in the code at compilation time as the
 path to the share/met installation directory (<prefix>/share/met).
 MET_BASE may be used in the MET configuration files when specifying paths
 and the appropriate path will be substituted in.
 If MET_BASE is defined as an environment variable, its value will be used
 instead of the one defined at compilation time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
An error in the syntax of a configuration file will result in an error from
 the MET tool stating the location of the parsing error.
