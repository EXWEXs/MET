\begin_layout Standard

This user's guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
 Tools (MET).
 MET is a set of verification tools developed by the Developmental Testbed
 Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather prediction community - and
 especially users and developers of the Weather Research and Forecasting
 (WRF) model - to help them assess and evaluate the performance of numerical
 weather predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
It is important to note here that MET is an evolving software package.
 Previous releases of MET have occurred each year since 2008.
 This documentation describes the 5.1 release from 2015.
 Intermediate releases may include bug fixes.
 MET is also be able to accept new modules contributed by the community.
 If you have code you would like to contribute, we will gladly consider
 your contribution.
 Please send email to: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "met_help@ucar.edu"
type "mailto:"

\end_inset

.
 We will then determine the maturity of new verification method and coordinate
 the inclusion of the new module in a future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of the MET, including Tressa
 Fowler, John Halley Gotway, Randy Bullock, Kathryn Newman, Julie Prestopnik,
 Lisa Goodrich, Tara Jensen, Barbara Brown, Nancy Rehak, Paul Oldenburg,
 Anne Holmes, Lacey Holland, David Ahijevych, Eric Gilleland and Bonny Strong.

 verification software.
 Thanks also go to the staff at the Developmental Testbed Center for their
 help, advice, and many types of support.
 We are grateful to the individuals who participated in MET planning workshops
 in February 2007, April 2008, August 2009, and November 2010; the ideas
 generated at those workshops will help MET grow in future years.
 Finally, we would like to specifically thank the verification advisory
 group (Mike Baldwin, Matthew Sittel, Elizabeth Ebert, Geoff DiMego, Chris
 Davis, and Jason Knievel) for their guidance and other contributions.
