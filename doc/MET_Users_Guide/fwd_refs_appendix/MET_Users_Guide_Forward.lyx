This user's guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
 Tools (MET).
 MET is a set of verification tools developed by the Developmental Testbed
 Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather prediction community - and
 especially users and developers of the Weather Research and Forecasting
 (WRF) model - to help them assess and evaluate the performance of numerical
 weather predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
It is important to note here that MET is an evolving software package.
 Previous releases of MET have occurred each year since 2008.
 This documentation describes the 5.1 release from 2015.
 Intermediate releases may include bug fixes.
 In the future, MET will also be able to accept new modules contributed
 by the community.
 A protocol will be established to determine the maturity of new verification
 methods that are contributed and to coordinate the inclusion of new modules
 in future versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This user's guide was prepared by the developers of the MET, including John
 Halley Gotway, Randy Bullock, Nancy Rehak, Julie Prestopnik, Paul Oldenburg,
 Anne Holmes, Tara Jensen, Lacey Holland, Barbara Brown, Tressa Fowler,
 David Ahijevych, Eric Gilleland and Bonny Strong.

METv5.1 includes several new tools and enhancements.
 The six new tools are MODE Time Domain (mtd), regrid_data_plane, shift_data_pla
ne, gen_vx_mask, gsid2mpr, and gsidens2mpr.
 Major enhancments for this release include automated regridding of data,
 generalized definition of thresholds, conditional continuous statistics,
 and the expanded use of climatology data.
