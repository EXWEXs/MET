Foreword: A note to MET users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
This user's guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
 Tools (MET).
 MET is a set of verification tools developed by the Developmental Testbed
 Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather prediction community - and
 especially users and developers of the Weather Research and Forecasting
 (WRF) model - to help them assess and evaluate the performance of numerical
 weather predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
It is important to note here that MET is an evolving software package.
 Previous releases of MET have occurred each year since 2008.
 This documentation describes the 5.1 release from 2014.
 Intermediate releases may include bug fixes.
 In the future, MET will also be able to accept new modules contributed
 by the community.
 A protocol will be established to determine the maturity of new verification
 methods that are contributed and to coordinate the inclusion of new modules
 in future versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
This user's guide was prepared by the developers of the MET, including John
 Halley Gotway, Randy Bullock, Nancy Rehak, Julie Prestopnik, Paul Oldenburg,
 Anne Holmes, Tara Jensen, Lacey Holland, Barbara Brown, Tressa Fowler,
 David Ahijevych, Eric Gilleland and Bonny Strong.

\begin_layout Section*
New for MET v5.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Users will notice major upgrades for METv5.1.
 A list of these and other upgrades is included below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Major Upgrades:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
1.
 METv5.1 includes a major overhaul of the build process, the addition of
 two new tools, and several enhancements to existing tools.
 The build and installation process is now done using autoconf by running
 the "configure" script followed by "make install" and "make test".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
2.
 The new gen_circle_mask tool generates a verification masking region similar
 to the gen_poly_mask tool.
 It draws a circle of configurable radius around one or more lat/lon locations.
 It may be useful in defining areas close to radar locations or the area
 around a hurricane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
3.
 The new plot_mode_field tool reads one or more MODE NetCDF output files
 and creates PNG images to display the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Enhancements to Existing Tools:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Distributed latest set of bug fixes for METv4.1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changes to existing logic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fixed bug in STAT-Analysis when aggregating FSS values across multiple cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fixed bug in MODE where object intensity percentiles were only being computed
 over values greater than zero, rather than the full range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fixed bug in pcp_combine -varname option that was preventing the use of
 underscores in the output variable name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced TC-Pairs to refine interpretation of zeros as bad data in many
 of the input ATCF columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced MADIS2NC by adding support for mesonet datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Refined logic in TC-Pairs when computing consensus tracks by ensuring that
 the required members are present at each lead time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Major overhaul of the TC-Dland tool to compute global distances to land
 rather than being limited to the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins.
 Added a global 1/10th degree distance to land data file to the release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced STAT-Analysis by adding support for an aggregate_stat job type
 conversion of MPR to WDIR that reads UGRD and VGRD matched pair lines and
 computes aggregated wind direction errors.
 Added
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
-out_fcst_wind_thresh and -out_obs_wind_thresh options to filter the U/V
 pairs by wind speed prior to computing wind direction errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Added new output statistics:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the SL1L2 and SAL1L2 line types from Point-Stat and Grid-Stat by
 adding the mean absolute error (MAE), enabling MAE to be aggregated across
 multiple cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the CNT line type from Point-Stat and Grid-Stat by adding the inter-qua
rtile range of the error (EIQR) and the median absolute deviation (MAD).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the CTS line type from Point-Stat and Grid-Stat by adding the log
 odds ratio (LODDS), odds ratio skill score (ORSS), extreme dependency score
 (EDS), symmetric EDS (SEDS), extreme dependency index (EDI), symmetric
 EDI (SEDI), and the bias-adjusted Gilbert skill score (BAGSS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the NBRCNT line type from Grid-Stat by adding the asymptotic fractions
 skill score (AFSS), uniform fractions skill score (UFSS), and the forecast
 and observation rates (F_RATE and O_RATE).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the MPR line type from Point-Stat and the ORANK line type from
 Ensemble-Stat by adding the observation quality flag value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced Ensemble-Stat by adding the probability integral transform histogram
 (PHIST) line type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced STAT-Analysis to aggregate and recompute all the new statistics
 listed above.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Added new command line and configuration options:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat by adding a station id exclusion,
 sid_exc, option to the configuration file to easily discard specific stations
 known to contain bad data.
 See METv5.1/data/config/README for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced ASCII2NC and MADIS2NC by adding the -mask_poly and -mask_grid command
 line options to filter the point observations spatially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced STAT-Analysis to support comma-separated lists of values on the
 command line rather than using the same command line switch multiple times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the configuration files for MODE, Grid-Stat, and Wavelet-Stat to
 allow the user to select which fields should be included in the gridded
 NetCDF output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
See METv5.1/data/config/README for details.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced ASCII2NC by adding a message_type_map entry to the configuration
 file which defines a mapping of input little_R report types to output message
 types.
 Previously this mapping had been hard coded and any changes required recompilin
g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced MODE by adding a shift_right entry to configuration file to shift
 a global grid by some number of grid points.
 This enables the user to define the location of the longitude cut line
 for global grids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced TC-Pairs by refining the interp12 configuration option.
 See METv5.1/data/config/README-TC for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced TC-Stat by adding an event_equal_lead configuration option to list
 specific lead times that must be present for a track to be included in
 the event equalization logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced TC-Stat by refining the rapid intensification criteria in the rapid_int
en section of the configuration file.
 See METv5.1/data/config/README_TC for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Improved input and output behavior:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced MET's handling of NetCDF files by reading and applying the FillValue
 and/or missing_value variable attributes when parsing gridded data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced STAT-Analysis and MODE-Analysis to include column headers in the
 output file specified with the -dump_row option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the NetCDF output of MODE by adding convex hull polyline points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add the model name as a global attribute to the NetCDF output of Grid-Stat,
 Wavelet-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, MODE, and Series-Analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduced the file size of the PostScript files generated by the MET tools
 by adding zlib compression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enhanced the MODE PostScript files by placing the data into tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Right-justify all numeric output columns in the ASCII output of MET.
