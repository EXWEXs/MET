Frequently Asked Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 Why was the MET written largely in C++ instead of FORTRAN?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
MET relies upon the object-oriented aspects of C++, particularly in using
 the MODE tool.
 Due to time and budget constraints, it also makes use of a pre-existing
 forecast verification library that was developed at NCAR.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 Why is PrepBufr used?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
The first goal of MET was to replicate the capabilities of existing verification
 packages and make these capabilities available to both the DTC and the
 public.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 Why is GRIB used?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
Forecast data from both WRF cores can be processed into GRIB format, and
 it is a commonly accepted output format for many NWP models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 Is GRIB2 supported?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
Yes, forecast output in GRIB2 format can be read by MET.
 Be sure to compile the GRIB2 code by setting the appropriate configuration
 file options (see Chapter 2).

\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 How does MET differ from the previously mentioned existing verification
 packages?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
MET is an actively maintained, evolving software package that is being made
 freely available to the public through controlled version releases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 How does the MODE tool differ from the Grid-Stat tool?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
They offer different ways of viewing verification.
 The Grid-Stat tool provides traditional verification statistics, while
 MODE provides specialized spatial statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 Will the MET work on data in native model coordinates?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 N
\series medium
o - it will not.
 In the future, we may add options to allow additional model grid coordinate
 systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 How do I get help if my questions are not answered in the User's Guide?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
First, look on our website 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If that doesn't answer your question, then email:

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q.
 Where are the graphics?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 
\series medium
Currently, very few graphics are included.
 The plotting tools (plot_point_obs, plot_data_plane, and plot_mode_field)
 can help you visualize your raw data.
 Also, ncview can be used with the NetCDF output from MET tools to visualize
 results.
 Further graphics support will be made available in the future on the MET
 website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Troubleshooting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The first place to look for help with individual commands is this user's
 guide or the usage statements that are provided with the tools.
 Usage statements for the individual MET tools are available by simply typing
 the name of the executable in MET's 
\emph on
bin/ 
\emph default
directory.
 Example scripts available in the MET's 
\emph on
scripts/
\emph default
 directory show examples of how one might use these commands on example
 datasets.
 Here are suggestions on other things to check if you are having problems
 installing or running MET.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MET won't compile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Have you specified the locations of NetCDF, GNU Scientific Library, and
 BUFRLIB, and optional additional libraries using corresponding MET_ environment
 variables prior to running configure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Have these libraries been compiled and installed using the same set of
 compilers used to build MET?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Are you using NetCDF version 3.4 or version 4? Currently, only NetCDF version
 3.6 can be used with MET.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grid_stat won't run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Are both the observational and forecast datasets on the same grid?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MODE won't run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* If using precipitation, do you have the same accumulation periods for
 both the forecast and observations? (If you aren't sure, run pcp_combine.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Are both the observation and forecast datasets on the same grid?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Point_stat won't run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Have you run pb2nc first on your PrepBufr observation data?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General troubleshooting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* For configuration files used, make certain to use empty square brackets
 (e.g.
 [ ]) to indicate no stratification is desired.
 Do NOT use empty double quotation marks inside square brackets (e.g.
 [
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

]).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Have you designated all the required command line arguments?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
* Try rerunning with a higher verbosity level.
 Increasing the verbosity level to 4 or 5 prints much more diagnostic informatio
n to the screen.
