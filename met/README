     location of the F2C library.  Or leave empty for compilers which do not
     require it, such as GNU gfortran and PGI pgf77.

   - If compiling support for GRIB2, set "WITH_GRIB2" to 1 and set
     "GRIB2C_BASE", "GRIB2C_INCS", and "GRIB2C_LIBS" to point to the location
     of the GRIB2C library.

   - Edit the "ENABLE_TOOL_NAME" settings if you would like to disable the
     compilation of any of the MET tools.

   - Save and close the user_defs.mk file.

- Type 'make >& make_met.log &'

- Type 'tail -f make_met.log' to view the execution of the make.

- When make is finished, type 'CNTRL-C' to quit the tail.

- If all tools are enabled and the build is successful, the "bin" directory will
  contain  16 executables:
   - ascii2nc
   - ensemble_stat

- Type 'cd scripts' to enter the scripts directory

- Type './test_all.sh >& test_all.log &' to run all of the test scripts in the
  directory.  These test scripts use test data supplied with the tarball.  For
  instructions on running your own data, please refer to the MET User's Guide.

- Type 'tail -f test_all.log' to view the execution of the test script.

- When the test script is finished, type 'CNTRL-C' to quit the tail.

- Look in ../out to find the output files for these tests.

- In particular, check that the PB2NC tool ran without error.  If there was an
  error, try adding or removing "-DBLOCK4" from the ARCH_FLAGS line in the
  top-level Makefile.  Then rebuild MET, being sure to run "make clean" first.

Release Notes
================================================================================

Version 4.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - Users will notice two major upgrades for METv4.0:
      support for GRIB2 and a restructuring of the MET configuration files.
    
- Major Upgrades:
    - Added optional support for GRIB2.  This support depends on the external
      NCEP GRIB2 C-library.  Support for GRIB2 is enabled by setting the
      "WITH_GRIB2" flag in "user_defs.mk".
    - Restructured the MET configuration files to make them more readable and
      give the user finer control over the verification tasks to be performed.
      See "data/config/README" for more detail on the changes.

- Enhancements to Existing Tools:
    - Distributed latest set of bug fixes for METv3.1.
    - Enhanced Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat to apply filtering logic when
      encountering duplicate point observations at the same location.  See the
      "duplicate_flag" section in "data/config/README" for more detail.
    - Enhanced PCP-Combine to run on all supported gridded data file types,
      rather than just GRIB1.  Added -config command line option to specify the
      field to be processed.
    - Enhanced STAT-Analysis and MODE-Analysis by adding support for the
      -fcst_valid_hour and -obs_valid_hour filtering options.
    - Enhanced STAT-Analysis to aggregate multiple NBRCNT lines together for the
      "aggregate" job type.
    - Enhanced handling of GRIB1 and GRIB2 table information by reading it from
      data files at runtime rather than having it hard-coded in header files.
    - For Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, and MODE, moved
      support for the -fcst_valid, -fcst_lead, -obs_valid, and -obs_lead
      filtering options from the command line to the configuration files.
    - Updated the WWMCA tools to ensure that pixel age masking is optional.
    - Fixed STAT-Analysis bug in the computation of the GO Index.
    - Fixed Ensemble-Stat bug in the handling of missing data.
    - Fixed library code bug when applying polyline masks to global datasets.

- Enhancement to the Build Process:
    - Defined unit tests for each of the MET tools and major library
      functionality.  These tests are not distributed with the code but are
      routinely run during development to ensure that new development does not
      break existing functionality.

Version 3.1 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - The majority of the changes for METv3.1 are internal restructuring and
      streamlining of how MET reads gridded data, which should be transparent
      to the user. However, there have been several enhancements the typical
      user may notice. Please refer to the MET User's Guide for more detail on
      these additions.

- Major Upgrades:
    - Implemented a new data class hierarchy for reading gridded data files to
      enable future support of additional data formats, such as GRIB2.
    - Incorporated a new logger class throughout MET causing all messages
      printed to the screen to be prefixed with a message type of ERROR,
      WARNING, or DEBUG(N), where N indicates the debug level (default is 2):
        0: Suppress all messages except WARNING and ERROR.
        1: List input and output files.
        2: List summary processing information.
        3: List detailed processing information.
        4+: List detailed debugging information.
    - Added a -log command line option to all the MET tools to optionally
      write their output to a log file.
    - Changed how MET is storing gridded data from using an integer scale and
      offset to a double. The integer scale and offset approach used in prior
      versions of MET caused individual gridded data values to be stored using
      only five significant digits.
        - Comparing previous versions to METv3.1, users should notice only
          slight differences in the continuous statistics MET produces (CNT
          and SL1L2 line types).
        - However, users may notice more significant differences in statistics
          that are based on defining a threshold. Due to these precision issues,
          the contingency tables counts and statistics (CTC and CTS line types)
          MET produces may change significantly in METv3.1.
        - METv3.1 has enhanced precision over earlier versions and more
          accurately represents the input data and resulting statistical
          measures.

- New Tools:
    - Added new madis2nc tool to reformat MADIS NetCDF point observation files
      into a NetCDF format that MET can read. Currently supports METAR and RAOB
      types of MADIS files with additional MADIS data types to be added in
      future releases.
    - Added new plot_data_plane utility to read any supported gridded data file,
      select a field from that file, and render it as a PostScript image.

- Enhancements to Existing Tools:
    - Distributed latest set of bug fixes for METv3.0.1.
    - Changed the default output directory for the MET statistics tools from
      MET_BASE/out/tool_name to the current directory.
    - Enhanced plot_point_obs by adding a -data_file command line argument to
      specify the grid on which the points should be plotted. Included detailed
      DEBUG(4) information about the points being plotted.
    - Enhanced stat_analysis to enable job command arguments on the command line
      to be used in conjunction with a configuration file. Included detailed
      DEBUG(4) information when deriving wind directions.
    - Enhanced wwmca_regrid and wwmca_plot to specify the pixel age when
      processing the data.
    - Enhanced mode to perform the convolution step more quickly.
    - When using MET statistics tools (like grid_stat, point_stat, wavelet_stat,
      ensemble_stat, and mode) to verify the NetCDF output of other MET tools
      (like pcp_combine and ensemble_stat), added logic to look for the name
      and level NetCDF variable attributes. If present, write those values out
      into the FCST_VAR, OBS_VAR, FCST_LEV or OBS_LEV statistical output
      columns.
    - In the mode_analysis -summary job, modified the computation of the
      standard deviations by dividing by N-1 rather than N which will have a
      slight impact on the output.

- Enhancement to the Build Process:
    - Modified the configuration and build process for MET by grouping the
      parameters that the user needs to edit into a file named user_defs.mk in
      the top-level MET directory.
    - Reorganized the MET directory structure to use src, include, and lib
      sub-directories for the source code, headers, and compiled libraries,
      respectively.

Version 3.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - Initial release of the Ensemble-Stat tool. This tool will read an
      arbitrary number of deterministic forecast files and derive ensemble
      forecasts and statistics. Ensemble mean, spread, and probability are among
      the many fields that can be derived by this tool. Additionally, if
      corresponding observations are included, this tool will produce rank
      histograms, probability integral transform (PIT) values, and the
      continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).
    - Addition of a tools sub-directory for ancillary tools that may not be of
      general interest. These tools are not compiled unless the compilation flag
      is enabled in the top-level Makefile.
    - In the tools sub-directory, initial release of the wwmca_regrid and
      wwmca_plot tools for regridding and plotting the World Wide Merged Cloud
      Analysis (WWMCA) product from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).
    - In the tools sub-directory, initial release of plot_point_obs tool for
      plotting the locations of point observations in the MET NetCDF point
      observation file format.
    - Enhance MET to support the NetCDF output of the WRF-ARW pinterp tool. When
      reading gridded NetCDF data into the MET tools, users will now have to
      explicitly specify in the configuration file the names and dimensions of
      the NetCDF variables to be read.

- Library Code:
    - Enhance to read the gridded NetCDF output of the WRF-ARW pinterp tool.
    - Enhance to read the gridded NetCDF output of the MET Ensemble-Stat tool.
    - Enhance the NetCDF output of the MET tools to include global attributes
      for the MET version and MET tool used to create it.
    - Enhance the gridded NetCDF output of the MET tools to include variables
      specifying the latitude and longitude of each grid point so the data can
      be displayed using the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) tool from UCAR-Unidata.
    - Enhance the gridded NetCDF output of the MET tools to include a standard
      set of variable attributes containing timing information.
    - Enhance the parsing of the gridded NetCDF data files to be backwards
      compatible with METv2.0 so that METv3.0 can read the NetCDF output of the
      PCP-Combine tool from METv2.0.

- ASCII2NC and PB2NC Tools:
    - Enhance how accumulation intervals are stored in the NetCDF point
      observation files. Store them as seconds rather than hours to allow for
      sub-hourly accumulation intervals.

- PB2NC Tool:
    - Modify FORTRAN code to remove compiler warnings.
    - Modify logic of the "-dump" command line option to only do an ASCII dump
      for those message types actually requested in the configuration file.

- Gen-Poly-Mask Tool:
    - No changes.

- PCP-Combine Tool:
    - Enhance the error checking of command line arguments.
    - Enhance logic for the "-add" command to allow for an arbitrary number
      (1 or more) of input files to be added together.
    - Enhance to allow for multiple entries for the "-pcp_dir" command line
      argument to specify multiple search directories.
    - Enhance to allow for off-hour accumulation intervals by specifying them in
      HH[MMSS] format. Output NetCDF variables are named in APCP_HH or
      APCP_HHMMSS format.
    - Enhance to allow for off-hour data by specifying timestrings in
      YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]] format.
    - Modify how the "level" NetCDF variable attribute is written to be
      consistent with how the level information is written by the other MET
      tools.

- Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, and MODE Tools:
    - Add "-fcst_lead", "-fcst_valid", "-obs_lead", and "-obs_valid" command
      line options to explicitly specify which GRIB records to use. These are
      necessary when reading a GRIB file containing multiple output times.
    - Delete trailing spaces from the ASCII output files generated by these
      STAT tools, thus greatly reducing the file size of the output STAT files.
    - Enhance to write out error messages using human-readable time strings
      rather than unixtime.
    - Enhance to more closely check the equality of the input forecast and
      observation grids. Ensure that they are identical, rather than just having
      the same dimensions.

- Point-Stat and Grid-Stat Tools:
    - Enhance to parse NCEP's probability information from the GRIB Product
      Description Section, specifically for the Short-Range Ensemble Forecast
      (SREF) data.
    - In the probabilistic contingency table statistics (PSTD) line type, add
      the base rate as an output column (BASER).
    - In PSTD line type, move the "N_THRESH" output column after "TOTAL" to be
      consistent with the other probabilistic line types.
    - For the output probabilistic lines (PCT, PSTD, PJC, and PRC) in the
      "FCST_THRESH" output column, replace NA with a list of the actual
      probability thresholds used.
    - Add support for the multi-category contingency table counts and
      statistics, MCTC and MCTS output lines, respectively. Multi-category
      contingency tables are computed whenever the output flags for them is
      turned on and the user has specified multiple thresholds to be used.
    - Enhance to only require that users specify thresholds in the configuration
      file when they have selected output line types that actually require them.

- Point-Stat Tool:
    - Enhance to allow for the verification of ranges of vertical levels
      (e.g. TMP/Z30-60), rather than just ranges of pressure levels.
    - If one of the point observation files passed to Point-Stat doesn't exist,
      print a warning message rather than erroring out.
    - Rename command line option from "-ncfile" to "-point_obs" to be consistent
      with the Ensemble-Stat options.
    - Rename command line options from "-valid_beg" and "-valid_end" to
      "-obs_valid_beg" and "-obs_valid_end". Note that previous options do
      still work.
    - Add the station name as an output column (OBS_SID) in the matched pair
      (MPR) output line type.
    - Explicitly state the observation valid time in the "OBS_VALID_BEG" and
      "OBS_VALID_END" columns in the matched pair (MPR) output line type.
    - Add detailed logging information when verbosity is set to 3 or higher.
      For each verification task, dump out counts of reason codes listing why
      observations were not used.
    - Enhance the error checking to error out when the user has specified a
      gridded NetCDF forecast file but has not specified the verifying GRIB
      observations (obs_field) to be used in the configuration file.

- Grid-Stat Tool:
    - Add the "-interp_flag" configuration option to specify which fields
      should be smoothed.
    - Enhance the algorithm for computing fractional coverage for neighborhood
      verification methods, making the code run substantially faster for large
      neighborhood sizes.

- Wavelet-Stat Tool:
    - Enhance to allow the forecast and observation fields to be specified
      separately in the configuration file.

- Stat-Analysis Tool:
    - Add the "-column_eq" job command option for filtering STAT data.
    - Add the "-column_str" job command option to do string comparisons when
      filtering STAT data. This was added to filter on the station names listed
      in the "OBS_SID" column. Users may specify multiple values by providing a
      comma-separated list.
    - Enhance to parse and aggregate the RHIST and ORANK output lines from the
      Ensemble-Stat tool.
    - Enhance to parse and aggregate the MCTC and MCTS output lines from the
      Point-Stat and Grid-Stat tools.
    - Add "-tmp_dir" command line argument and fix bug in how the temporary
      directory is set.
    - Add the "-vif_flag" job command option to enable the computation of the
      variance inflation factor. Enabling the VIF causes the normal confidence
      intervals in the output statistics to be adjusted to account for lag 1
      autocorrelation when accumulating statistics through time.
    - Fix bug to enable Stat-Analysis to accumulate matched pair lines (MPR)
      and compute the MCTC or MCTS output line types.
    - Fix bug so that Stat-Analysis can parse strings like "PROB(TMP<273)" in
      the "FCST_VAR" and "OBS_VAR" columns when reading MPR lines.

- MODE Tool:
    - Shortened the output file naming convention by removing the fcst/obs
      variable/level information. Suggest using the "output_prefix"
      configuration option to customize output file names.

- MODE-Analysis Tool:
    - No changes.

Version 2.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- Build process
   - Add sample Makefile for building MET with Intel compilers.

- Library code
   - Restructure and rename output ASCII file format from VSDB to STAT and add
     output columns to store data in a more straight-forward way.
   - Enable more sophisticated masking for the Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, and MODE
     tools by reading the output of the Gen-Poly-Mask tool or any other gridded
     data field and, optionally, thresholding that field to define a masking
     region.

- ASCII2NC
   - Fix bug so that observations values from the same observing location are
     assigned the same header id.

- PB2NC
   - Remove requirement that PrepBufr files be Fortran-blocked prior to running
     through PB2NC.  The blocking is now done internally as specified in the
     ARCH_FLAGS in the top-level MET Makefile.  The "-DBLOCK4" flag indicates
     that 4-byte blocking should be performed instead of the default 8-byte
     blocking.  This is compiler-dependent.  The sample Makefiles contain a
     best guess for each compiler, but if you experience runtime errors from the
     PB2NC tool try adding or removing the "-DBLOCK4" flag, recompiling, and
     rerunning.
   - Running the PB2NC tool, which links to the BUFRLIB library, on 64-bit
     machines continues to be problematic.  Users may continue to build MET and
     the libraries on which it depends as 32-bit on 64-bit machines.  MET users
     will be notified when the BUFRLIB 64-bit issues are resolved.

- Gen-Poly-Mask
   - New for this release.

- PCP-Combine
   - Add the "-ptv" command line argument to specify which GRIB parameter table
     version number should be used.

- Grid-Stat
   - Modify how the user specifies the forecast and observation fields to be
     selected, thresholded, and compared.  The user can now select them
     independently and compare two different fields.
   - Add the option of specifying a level for a GRIB record as 'L', meaning any
