\begin_layout Chapter
The Series Analysis Tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Series-Analysis Tool accumulates statistics separately for each horizontal
 grid location over a series.
 Often, this series is over time or height, though any type of series is
 possible.
 This differs from the Grid-Stat tool in that Grid-Stat verifies all grid
 locations together as a group.
 Thus, the Series Analysis Tool can be used to find verification information
 specific to certain locations or to identify differences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Practical Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This section contains a description of how to configure and run the Series-Analy
sis tool.
 This tool performs verification of gridded model fields using matching
 gridded observation fields.
 The series analysis tool will produce a variety of user-selected statistics,
 a subset of those produced by the Grid-Stat tool and documented in Chapter
 5.
 However, these statistics will be produced separately for each grid location
 and accumulated over some series such as time or height, rather than accumulate
d over the whole domain for a single time or height as is done by Grid-Stat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This tool computes statistics for exactly one series each time it is run.
 Multiple series may be processed by running the tool multiple times.
 The length of the series to be processed is determined by the first of
 the following that is greater than one: the number of forecast fields in
 the configuration file, the number of observation fields in the configuration
 file, the number of input forecast files, the number of input observation
 files.
 Several examples of defining series are described below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To define a time series of forecasts where the valid time changes for each
 time step, set the forecast and observation fields in the configuration
 file to single values and pass the tool multiple forecast and observation
 files.
 The tool will loop over the forecast files, extract the specified field
 from each, and then search the observation files for a matching record
 with the same valid time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To define a time series of forecasts that all have the same valid time,
 set the forecast and observation fields in the configuration file to single
 values.
 Pass the tool multiple forecast files and a single observation file containing
 the verifying observations.
 The tool will loop over the forecast files, extract the specified field
 from each, and then retrieve the verifying observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To define a series of vertical levels all contained in a single input file,
 set the forecast and observation fields to a list of the vertical levels
 to be used.
 Pass the tool single forecast and observation files containing the vertical
 level data.
 The tool will loop over the forecast field entries, extract that field
 from the input forecast file, and then search the observation file for
 a matching record.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
series_analysis output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Series-Analysis tool produces NetCDF files containing output statistics
 for each grid location from the input files.
 The details about the output statistics available from each output line
 type are detailed in Chapter 5 since they are also produced by the Grid-Stat
 Tool.
 A subset of these can be produced by this tool, with the most notable exception
s being the wind vector and neighborhood statistics.
 Users can inventory the contents of the Series-Analysis output files using
 the ncdump -h command to view header information.
 Additionally, ncview or the plot_data_plane tool can be used to visualize
 the output.
 An example of Series-Analysis output is shown in Figure

 group contains information about the model forecast fields, levels and
 thresholds to use in verification.
 The 
\series bold

\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of model variables and corresponding
 vertical levels to be verified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For GRIB files, the GRIB code itself or the corresponding abbreviation may
 be used to specify which model fields are to be verified.
 A level indicator in the form 
\series bold
"ANNN", "ZNNN", "PNNN", "PNNN-NNN", "LNNN"
\series default
, 
\series medium
or
\series default
 
\series bold
"RNNN"
\series default
 
\series medium
must correspond to each field name.
 These indicate an accumulation interval, a single vertical level, a single
 pressure level, a range of pressure levels, a generic level, and a specific
 GRIB record number, respectively.

\series default
 
\series bold
"NNN"
\series default
 
\series medium
indicates the accumulation or level value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To specify verification fields for NetCDF files, the name of the NetCDF
 variable should appear in the name field.
 The level field should be of the form (i,...,j,*,*) for a single field.
 Here, i,...,j specifies fixed dimension values, and *,* specifies the two
 dimensions for the gridded field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The values listed above indicate that specific humidity, temperature, height,
 wind speed, and the U and V components of the winds should all be verified
 at 500 mb.
 All variables are treated as scalar quantities with the exception of the
 U and V components of the wind.
 When the U component is followed by the V component, both with the same
 level indicator, they will be treated as vector quantities.
 A list of GRIB codes is available at

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Wind speed is typically not available in model files, but if it is, it
 will be used directly.
 However, if wind speed is unavailable but the U and V components of the
 wind are included, the wind speed will be calculated automatically by MET,
 provided that WIND is included in the 
\series bold
field 
\series medium
group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For each 
\series bold
name 
\series medium
listed in the forecast field, one or more thresholds must be specified for
 use in computing discrete statistics.
 The thresholds are specified using >, >=, ==, !=, <, <=.
 Multiple thresholds may be applied to each field code by providing a comma-sepa
rated list.
 It is the user's responsibility to know the units for each model variable
 and to choose appropriate threshold values.
 For probabilistic forecast, thresholds must be specified using >= convention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To indicate that a forecast field should be treated as probabilities, set
 the prob field to TRUE.
 Probability fields should contain values in the range [0, 1] or [0, 100].
 However, when MET encounters a probability field with a range [0, 100],
 it will automatically rescale it to be [0, 1] before applying the probabilistic
 verification methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series bold
obs
\series default
 
\series medium
group can be defined in the same way as the forecast group.
 However, for most users, setting obs=fcst to use the same settings will
 be most valuable.
 The variables are identical those in the 
\series default
fcst 
\series medium
except that they apply to the observation field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For each observation field, one or more thresholds can be specified for

group defines the parameters to be used in calculation of bootstrap confidence
 intervals.
 The
\series default
 
\series bold
interval
\series default
 
\series medium
variable indicates what method should be used for computing bootstrap confidence
 intervals.
 A value of BCA indicates that the highly accurate but computationally intensive
 BCa (bias-corrected percentile) method should be used.
 A value of PCTILE indicates that the somewhat less accurate but efficient
 percentile method should be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series bold
rep_prop
\series default
 
\series medium
variable must be set to a value between 0 and 1.
 When computing bootstrap confidence intervals over n sets of matched pairs,
 the size of the subsample, m, may be chosen less than or equal to the size
 of the sample, n.
 This variable defines the size of m as a proportion relative to the size
 of n.
 A value of 1, as shown above, indicates that the size of the subsample,
 m, should be equal to the size of the sample, n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series bold
n_rep
\series default
 
\series medium
variable defines the number of subsamples that should be taken when computing
 bootstrap confidence intervals.
 This variable should be set large enough so that when confidence intervals
 are computed multiple times for the same set of data, the intervals do
 not change much.
 Setting this variable to zero disables the computation of bootstrap confidence
 intervals, which may be necessary to run MET in realtime or near-realtime
 over large domains since bootstrapping is computationally expensive.
 Setting this variable to 1000, as shown above, indicates that bootstrap
 confidence interval should be computed over 1000 subsamples of the matched
 pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series bold
rng
\series default
 
\series medium
variable defines the random number generator to be used in the computation
 of bootstrap confidence intervals.
 Subsamples are chosen at random from the full set of matched pairs.
 The randomness is determined by the random number generator specified.
 Users should refer to detailed documentation of the GNU Scientific Library
 for a listing of the random number generators available for use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The
\series default
 
\series bold
seed
\series default
 
\series medium
variable may be set to a specific value to make the computation of bootstrap
 confidence intervals fully repeatable.
 When left empty, as shown above, the random number generator seed is chosen
 automatically which will lead to slightly different bootstrap confidence
 intervals being computed each time the data is run.
 Specifying a value here ensures that the bootstrap confidence intervals
 will be computed the same over multiple runs of the same data.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The
\series default
 
\series bold
poly
\series default
 
\series medium
variable contains a single of file that defines the verification masking
 regions.
 This masking regions may be specified in two ways: as a lat/lon polygon
 or using a gridded data file such as the NetCDF output of the Gen-Poly-Mask
 or Gen-Circle_mask tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Several masking polygons used by NCEP are predefined in the installed share/met/
poly directory.
 Creating a new polygon is as simple as creating a text file with a name
 for the polygon followed by the lat/lon points which define its boundary.
 Adding a new masking polygon requires no code changes and no recompiling.
 Internally, the lat/lon polygon points are converted into x/y values in
 the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Alternatively, any gridded data file that MET can read may be used to define
 a verification masking region.
 Users must specify a description of the field to be used from the input
 file and, optionally, may specify a threshold to be applied to that field.
 Any grid point where the resulting field is 0, the mask is turned off.
 Any grid point where it is non-zero, the mask is turned on.

The
\series default
 rank_corr_flag 
\series medium
variable may be set to 
\series default
TRUE 
\series medium
or
\series default
 FALSE 
\series medium
to indicate whether or not Kendall's Tau and Spearman's Rank correlation
 coefficients should be computed.
 The computation of these rank correlation coefficients is very slow when
 run over many matched pairs.
 By default, this flag is turned on, as shown above, but setting it to 
\series default
FALSE 
\series medium
should improve the runtime performance.
