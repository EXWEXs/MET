Dependencies
------------

- MET requires the following to be installed on your system prior to building:
   - NCEP's BUFRLIB Library
      - http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB
   - UniData's NetCDF Library version 3
      - http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf
   - GNU Scientific Library (GSL), developer's version
      - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl
   - The F2C (or G2C) library for interfacing between fortran and C code
      - Not needed for PGI or GNU-gfortran compiler.
      - http://www.netlib.org/f2c

- It is suggested that the following tools be used in conjunction with MET:
   - WRF Post-Processor
      - http://www.dtcenter.org/wrf-nmm/users
   - The "copygb" utility distributed with the WRF Post-Processor

NOTE: The required libraries should be compiled with the same set of compilers
      to be used in compiling MET.

How to compile and run?
-----------------------

For more detailed instructions on building MET and for a list of supported
platforms and compilers, please refer to the MET User's Guide in the doc/
subdirectory.

- In the top level directory, sample Makefiles are provided for compiling with
  GNU, PGI, Intel, or IBM compilers.  Make a copy of appropriate Makefile.
  For example:

   - cp Makefile_gnu Makefile

- Next, configure the Makefile as follows:
   - Set "MAKE" to the full path for the GNU Make utility.
   - Set "ARCH_FLAGS" architecture flags as needed.

   - Set "CXX" to the full path for your C++ compiler
     (recommend GNU g++, PGI pgCC, or IBM xlC).
   - Set "CXX_FLAGS" to the C++ compiler flags to be used.
   - Set "CXX_LIBS" to link to any additional libraries required for the C++
     compiler.

   - Set "FC" to the full path for your Fortran compiler
     (recommend GNU g77/gfortran, PGI pgf77, or IBM xlf).
   - Set "FC_FLAGS" to the Fortran compiler flags to be used.
   - Set "FC_LIBS" to link to any additional libraries required for the Fortran
     compiler.

   - Set "NETCDF_BASE", "NETCDF_INCS", and "NETCDF_LIBS" to point to the
     location of the NetCDF library.

   - Set "BUFR_BASE", "BUFR_INCS", and "BUFR_LIBS" to point to the location
     of the BUFRLIB library.

   - Set "GSL_BASE", "GSL_INCS", and "GSL_LIBS" to point to the location of the
     GSL library.

   - Set "F2C_BASE", "F2C_INCS", "F2C_LIBS", and "F2C_LIBNAME" to point to the
     location of the F2C library.  Or leave empty for compilers which do not
     require it, such as GNU gfortran and PGI pgf77.

   - If you would like to compile the optional tools directory, set "DISABLE_TOOLS"
     value to zero. 

- Type 'make >& make_met.log &'

- Type 'tail -f make_met.log' to view the execution of the make.

- When make is finished, type 'CNTRL-C' to quit the tail.

- If sucessful, this will create 11 executables in the bin directory:
   - ascii2nc
   - ensemble_stat
   - gen_poly_mask
   - grid_stat
   - mode
   - mode_analysis
   - pb2nc
   - pcp_combine
   - point_stat
   - stat_analysis
   - wavelet_stat

- Type 'ls bin' to check for the presence of the 11 executables.

- Type 'cd scripts' to enter the scripts directory

- Type './test_all.sh >& test_all.log &' to run all of the test scripts in the
  directory.  These test scripts use test data supplied with the tarball.  For
  instructions on running your own data, please refer to the MET User's Guide.

- Type 'tail -f test_all.log' to view the execution of the test script.

- When the test script is finished, type 'CNTRL-C' to quit the tail.

- Look in ../out to find the output files for these tests.

- In particular, check that the PB2NC tool ran without error.  If there was an
  error, try adding or removing "-DBLOCK4" from the ARCH_FLAGS line in the
  top-level Makefile.  Then rebuild MET, being sure to run "make clean" first.

Release Notes
================================================================================

Version 3.0.1 Release Notes:
---------------------------

- What's New:
    - Distribute latest set of bug fixes for METv3.0.
    - Add support for the biliear interpolation method when verifying with point
      observations in the Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat tools.
    - Modify the algorithm used to derive relative humidity for point
      observations in the PB2NC tool to be consistent with the method used by
      the NCEP Unified-PostProcessor (UPP).
    - Change the assumed radius of the earth from 6367.47km to 6371.20km to be
      consistent with NCEP's w3 library used by WRF and UPP, including copygb.

Version 3.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - Initial release of the Ensemble-Stat tool. This tool will read an
      arbitrary number of deterministic forecast files and derive ensemble
      forecasts and statistics. Ensemble mean, spread, and probability are among
      the many fields that can be derived by this tool. Additionally, if
      corresponding observations are included, this tool will produce rank
      histograms, probability integral transform (PIT) values, and the
      continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).
    - Addition of a tools subdirectory for ancillary tools that may not be of
      general interest. These tools are not compiled unless the compilation flag
      is enabled in the top-level Makefile.
    - In the tools subdirectory, initial release of the wwmca_regrid and
      wwmca_plot tools for regridding and plotting the World Wide Merged Cloud
      Analysis (WWMCA) product from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).
    - In the tools subdirectory, initial release of plot_point_obs tool for
      plotting the locations of point observations in the MET NetCDF point
      observation file format.
    - Enhance MET to support the NetCDF output of the WRF-ARW pinterp tool. When
      reading gridded NetCDF data into the MET tools, users will now have to
      explicitly specify in the configuraiton file the names and dimensions of
      the NetCDF variables to be read.

- Library Code:
    - Enhance to read the gridded NetCDF output of the WRF-ARW pinterp tool.
    - Enhance to read the gridded NetCDF output of the MET Ensemble-Stat tool.
    - Enhance the NetCDF output of the MET tools to include global attributes
      for the MET version and MET tool used to create it.
    - Enhance the gridded NetCDF output of the MET tools to include variables
      specifying the latitude and longitude of each grid point so the data can
      be displayed using the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) tool from UCAR-Unidata.
    - Enhance the gridded NetCDF output of the MET tools to include a standard
      set of variable attributes containing timing information.
    - Enhance the parsing of the gridded NetCDF data files to be backwards
      compatible with METv2.0 so that METv3.0 can read the NetCDF output of the
      PCP-Combine tool from METv2.0.

- ASCII2NC and PB2NC Tools:
    - Enhance how accumulation intervals are stored in the NetCDF point
      observation files. Store them as seconds rather than hours to allow for
      sub-hourly accumulation intervals.

- PB2NC Tool:
    - Modify FORTRAN code to remove compiler warnings.
    - Modify logic of the "-dump" command line option to only do an ASCII dump
      for those message types actually requested in the configuration file.

- Gen-Poly-Mask Tool:
    - No changes.

- PCP-Combine Tool:
    - Enhance the error checking of command line arguments.
    - Enhance logic for the "-add" command to allow for an arbitrary number
      (1 or more) of input files to be added together.
    - Enhance to allow for multiple entries for the "-pcp_dir" command line
      argument to specify multiple search directories.
    - Enhance to allow for off-hour accumulation intervals by specifying them in
      HH[MMSS] format. Output NetCDF variables are named in APCP_HH or
      APCP_HHMMSS format.
    - Enhance to allow for off-hour data by specifying timestrings in
      YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]] format.
    - Modify how the "level" NetCDF variable attribute is written to be
      consistent with how the level information is written by the other MET
      tools.

- Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, and MODE Tools:
    - Add "-fcst_lead", "-fcst_valid", "-obs_lead", and "-obs_valid" command
      line options to explicitly specify which GRIB records to use. These are
      necessary when reading a GRIB file containing multiple output times.
    - Delete trailing spaces from the ASCII output files generated by these
      STAT tools, thus greatly reducing the file size of the output STAT files.
    - Enhance to write out error messages using human-readable time strings
      rather than unixtime.
    - Enhance to more closely check the equality of the input forecast and
      observation grids. Ensure that they are identical, rather than just having
      the same dimensions.

- Point-Stat and Grid-Stat Tools:
    - Enhance to parse NCEP's probability information from the GRIB Product
      Description Section, specifically for the Short-Range Ensemble Forecast
      (SREF) data.
    - In the probabilistic contingency table statistics (PSTD) line type, add
      the base rate as an output column (BASER).
    - In PSTD line type, move the "N_THRESH" output column after "TOTAL" to be
      consistent with the other probabilistic line types.
    - For the output probabilistic lines (PCT, PSTD, PJC, and PRC) in the
      "FCST_THRESH" output column, replace NA with a list of the actual
      probability thresholds used.
    - Add support for the multi-category contingency table counts and
      statistics, MCTC and MCTS output lines, respectively. Multi-category
      contingency tables are computed whenever the output flags for them is
      turned on and the user has specified multiple thresholds to be used.
    - Enhance to only require that users specify thresholds in the configuration
      file when they have selected output line types that actually require them.

- Point-Stat Tool:
    - Enhance to allow for the verification of ranges of vertical levels
      (e.g. TMP/Z30-60), rather than just ranges of pressure levels.
    - If one of the point observation files passed to Point-Stat doesn't exist,
      print a warning message rather than erroring out.
    - Rename command line option from "-ncfile" to "-point_obs" to be consistent
      with the Ensemble-Stat options.
    - Rename command line options from "-valid_beg" and "-valid_end" to
      "-obs_valid_beg" and "-obs_valid_end". Note that previous options do
      still work.
    - Add the station name as an output column (OBS_SID) in the matched pair
      (MPR) output line type.
    - Explicitly state the observation valid time in the "OBS_VALID_BEG" and
      "OBS_VALID_END" columns in the matched pair (MPR) output line type.
    - Add detailed logging information when verbosity is set to 3 or higher.
      For each verification task, dump out counts of reason codes listing why
      observations were not used.
    - Enhace the error checking to error out when the user has specified a
      gridded NetCDF forecast file but has not specified the verifying GRIB
      observations (obs_field) to be used in the configuration file.

- Grid-Stat Tool:
    - Add the "-interp_flag" configuration option to specify which fields
      should be smoothed.
    - Enhance the algorithm for computing fractional coverage for neighborhood
      verification methods, making the code run substantially faster for large
      neighborhood sizes.

- Wavelet-Stat Tool:
    - Enhance to allow the forecast and observation fields to be specified
      separately in the configuration file.

- Stat-Analysis Tool:
    - Add the "-column_eq" job command option for filtering STAT data.
    - Add the "-column_str" job command option to do string comparisons when
      filtering STAT data. This was added to filter on the station names listed
      in the "OBS_SID" column. Users may specify multiple values by providing a
      comma-separated list.
    - Enhance to parse and aggregate the RHIST and ORANK output lines from the
      Ensemble-Stat tool.
    - Enhance to parse and aggregate the MCTC and MCTS output lines from the
      Point-Stat and Grid-Stat tools.
    - Add "-tmp_dir" command line argument and fix bug in how the temporary
      directory is set.
    - Add the "-vif_flag" job command option to enable the computation of the
      variance inflation factor. Enabling the VIF causes the normal confidence
      intervals in the output statistics to be adjusted to account for lag 1
      autocorrelation when accumulating statistics through time.
    - Fix bug to enable Stat-Analysis to accumulate matched pair lines (MPR)
      and compute the MCTC or MCTS output line types.
    - Fix bug so that Stat-Analysis can parse strings like "PROB(TMP<273)" in
      the "FCST_VAR" and "OBS_VAR" columns when reading MPR lines.

- MODE Tool:
    - Shortened the output file naming convention by removing the fcst/obs
      variable/level information. Suggest using the "output_prefix"
      configuration option to customize output file names.

- MODE-Analysis Tool:
    - No changes.

Version 2.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- Build process
   - Add sample Makefile for building MET with Intel compilers.

- Library code
   - Restructure and rename output ASCII file format from VSDB to STAT and add
     output columns to store data in a more straight-forward way.
   - Enable more sophisticated masking for the Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, and MODE
     tools by reading the output of the Gen-Poly-Mask tool or any other gridded
     data field and, optionally, thresholding that field to define a masking
     region.

- ASCII2NC
   - Fix bug so that observations values from the same observing location are
     assigned the same header id.

- PB2NC
   - Remove requirement that PrepBufr files be Fortran-blocked prior to running
     through PB2NC.  The blocking is now done internally as specified in the
     ARCH_FLAGS in the top-level MET Makefile.  The "-DBLOCK4" flag indicates
     that 4-byte blocking should be performed instead of the default 8-byte
     blocking.  This is compiler-dependent.  The sample Makefiles contain a
     best guess for each compiler, but if you experience runtime errors from the
     PB2NC tool try adding or removing the "-DBLOCK4" flag, recompiling, and
     rerunning.
   - Running the PB2NC tool, which links to the BUFRLIB library, on 64-bit
     machines continues to be problematic.  Users may continue to build MET and
     the libraries on which it depends as 32-bit on 64-bit machines.  MET users
     will be notified when the BUFRLIB 64-bit issues are resolved.

- Gen-Poly-Mask
   - New for this release.

- PCP-Combine
   - Add the "-ptv" command line argument to specify which GRIB parameter table
     version number should be used.

- Grid-Stat
   - Modify how the user specifies the forecast and observation fields to be
     selected, thresholded, and compared.  The user can now select them
     independently and compare two different fields.
   - Add the option of specifying a level for a GRIB record as 'L', meaning any
     generic level type, as opposed to specifying a pressure level or vertical
     level.
   - Add support for verifying probabilistic forecasts and add new output line
     types to store the output.  Probablistic data may have a range of values
     of [0, 1] or [0, 100].  However, probablistic data with a range of [0, 100]
     will first be rescaled to [0, 1] before verifying it.
   - Add configurable wind speed threshold parameters to specify which (U, V)
     points should be included in the VL1L2 partial sums.
   - Change the "ncep_defaults" configurable parameter to "grib_ptv" to specify
     which GRIB parameter table version number should be used.
   - Add an "output_prefix" configurable parameter to include a user-specified
     string in the output file names.

- Point-Stat
   - Same as Grid-Stat, see above.

- Wavelet-Stat
   - New for this release.

- STAT-Analysis
   - Rename the VSDB-Analysis tool to the STAT-Analysis tool and modify it to
     read the STAT output lines from the other MET tools.
   - Simplify names for jobs.
   - Add support for converting VL1L2 STAT lines into information about wind
     direction errors.
   - Add support for reading and aggregating the ISC STAT line from the
     Wavelet-Stat tool.
   - Add support for reading and aggregating the new probability STAT line
     types (PCT, PSTD, PJC, and PRC) from the Grid-Stat and Point-Stat tools.

- MODE
   - Change the "ncep_defaults" configurable parameter to "grib_ptv" to specify
     which GRIB parameter table version number should be used.
   - Add an "output_prefix" configurable parameter to include a user-specified
     string in the output file names.
   - Modify the output PostScript file to include new summary measures on the
     first page and add a page listing out the pairwise attributes of the
     matched cluster (formerly called "composite") objects.
   - Add a column to the MODE output files for the VERSION number of MODE that
     generated the file.
   - Add a column to the MODE output files for the AREA_THRESH value.

- MODE-Analysis
   - Modify to read the latest MODE output columns.

     Point-Stat.

- PCP-Combine
   - Add "-add" command line option to add together accumulation intervals
     from two Grib files directly.
   - Add "-subtract" command line option to take the difference of accumulation
     intervals from two Grib files directly.
   - Add "-gc" command line option to allow the user to specify which grib
     code to use.

- Point-Stat
   - Add "-ncfile" command line option to process multiple NetCDF point
     observation files.
   - Add the ability to dump out the matched pair data (forecast, observation,
     climatology) directly to ASCII and VSDB files.
   - Add output matched pair (MPR) line type to store matched pair data.
   - Compute bootstrap confidence intervals for the Contingency Table Statistics
     (CTS) and Continuous Statistics (CNT) line types.
   - Add 5 parameters to the configuration file for options related to computing

     indicate that statistics should be computed over the entire domain.

- MODE
   - Add "met_data_dir" configuration parameter to point to the location of
     static data files MODE needs for plotting.  It should be set if MODE is
     moved from its original installation directory.
   - Enhance the way colorbars are plotted in the PostScript output and add a
     "stride_length" configuration parameter to indicate how often labels should
     be plotted alongside the colorbar.

  - Retrieve the data level category value from the bottom of the event stack
    which is the only place it is defined.
  - Derive additional observation variables, such as dewpoint temperature, wind
    speed, relative humidity, mixing ratio, and pressure-reduced to mean sea
    level.
  - Correct units for specific humidity.

- PCP-Combine
  - Change the format of the input date/time.

- Point-Stat
  - Support message type strings "ANYAIR", "ANYSFC", and "ONLYSF".  See the
    default configuration file for details.
  - Add "mask_stations" to the configuration file to perform verification at
    individual stations.
  - Derive wind speed in the forecast field from the U and V components of wind.
  - Compute additional continuous statistics, such as Spearman rank correlation
    coefficient, Kendall's Tau statistic.
  - Add the least-squares interpolation method.
  - Add confidence intervals for several categorical statistics.
  - Climatology files now correctly being accepted.
  - Fix a problem with rotating winds from grid-relative coordinates to
    earth-relative coordinates.
  - Make changes to the output file format (refer to Chapter 4 of the MET User's
    Guide).
  - Make changes to the output file names (by valid time, not init time).

- Grid-Stat
  - Enhance the NetCDF output file.  In addition to the forecast-observation
    difference, the raw forecast and observation fields are included.
  - Add "interp_method" and "interp_width" to the configuration file to
    optionally smooth the forecast field prior to performing verification.
  - Compute additional continuous statistics, such as Spearman rank correlation
    coefficient, Kendall's Tau statistic.
  - Add confidence intervals for several categorical statistics.
  - Fix a problem with rotating winds from grid-relative coordinates to
    earth-relative coordinates.
  - Make changes to output file format (refer to Chapter 5 of the MET User's
    Guide).
  - Make changes to the output file names (by valid time, not init time).

- MODE
  - Change "vx_grib_code" to "fcst_grib_code" and "obs_grib_code" in the
    configuration file to derive and compare objects from different raw fields.
  - Change "raw_color_table" to "fcst_raw_color_table" and "obs_raw_color_table"
    in the configuration file to plot the raw fields using different
    colortables.
  - Add "fcst/obs_raw_plot_min" and "fcst/obs_raw_plot_max" to the configuration
    file to rescale the raw colortables using the range specified.
  - Add "plot_valid_flag" to the configuration file to plot only the region of
    the input fields containing valid data.
  - Add "plot_gcarc_flag" to the configuration file to enable polyline to be
    plotted using great circle arcs or straight line segments in the grid.
  - Make changes to the output file format and column names (refer to Chapter 6
    of the MET User's Guide).
  - Make changes to the output file names (by valid time, not init time).

- Analysis tools
  - VSDB and MODE analysis tools are now available.
